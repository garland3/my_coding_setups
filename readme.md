# My coding setups

* Things I often do and throw in readme's but which were across my projects. 
* Also I find helpful information and then forget it, so this is quick reference for myself. 
* I have several of these items in `gists` already and reference them often, but I feel like a more structured approach would be better. 

## VScode

I like to use VScode.

### Extensions

Here are my extensions that I think are helpful
 
 * `Git Project Manager`. lets you click on a few things rather than remembering all the `git commands`. 
 * `Docker`  for docker syntax highlighting
 * `Python` from microsoft
 * `Pylance` language server for python. If it is having a hard time finding a package, you might need to add the path explicitly. 
     - Go to settings
     - Search for `add item`
     - find the `python -> analysis:Extra paths`
     - add the `../site-packages` or where ever the path you want to add is actually located. 
     - You do this by clicking `add Item`
 * `Remote - Containers` Lets you develop INSIDE a container which is super helpful. 
 *  Remote SSH` Same
 * `Remote Development` Same. 
 * CSV color highlighter??
 * `google-search` maybe. still experimenting with this one. 

### VScode short cuts
I can never remember them all, but here are some that are helpful. 
* `ctrl` + `p` then type the name of a file, to go that file. 
* `ctrl` +  `shift`  + `p` to open the command center
* `ctrl` + ``` to go the terminal
* `ctrl` + `1` or (`2` , ...) to go to the split window text editor (or open it)
